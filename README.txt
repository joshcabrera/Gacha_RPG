# Gacha RPG

Gacha RPG is a command-line single player game modeled after typical 
Gacha games. It is different in that gates to gameplay are minimized. 
It is possible to play as much as you want without having to wait for 
energy to recharge or refresh. Characters are unlocked via completing 
levels rather than spending currency.
